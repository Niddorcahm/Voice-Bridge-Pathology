# ==========================================
# Security Considerations
# ==========================================

# When installing in medical environments:
# 1. Verify all package sources and checksums
# 2. Use isolated virtual environments
# 3. Keep dependencies updated for security patches
# 4. Review Azure SDK privacy and security policies
# 5. Implement network security appropriate for medical data

# ==========================================
# Version Pinning Strategy
# ==========================================

# Core dependencies are pinned to specific versions for stability
# Testing and development tools use minimum versions for flexibility
# Standard library components are listed for documentation
# Optional components are commented to avoid unnecessary installations
